# MMSR-Project_GroupA
Project for the course "Multimedia Search and Retrieval 2022W" of group A. 

All the mentioned tsv files from the documentation need to be in the resource folder!


Using the Generate_testing_set.py creates a new folder containing smaller datsets of the tsv files. 
The weighting_main.py was used to find good weights but is not needed or required to run it again. 

Lastly in the main.py lies the hearth of our application it includes all the code to read the tsv files and create all
the metrics/plots. 

Needed packages are: 

matplotlib.pyplot
numpy 
pandas 
scipy.stats 
sklearn.decomposition 
sklearn.metrics.pairwise
